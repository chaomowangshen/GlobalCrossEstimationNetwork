# GlobalCrossEstimationNetwork
A project for calculating IRT parameters

According to the experimental design, run pre_data.py to generate the simulated data required for the study.
In the run directory, locate the Python script for processing the simulated data and run it to view the results of the simulated study.
The empirical research is conducted in the empirical.ipynb file located in the picture directory. Please ensure that the R language environment is configured in the Conda environment, as the traditional method is implemented using the mirt package in R.
